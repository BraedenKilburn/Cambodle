# Cambodle

## Summary

[Cambodle](https://cambodle.braedenkilburn.com/), based on the web-based word game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), is a simple game in which the player must guess the highlighted Cambodian province of the day. They must guess this within six tries and, if they do not succeed, they will lose the game and the province will be revealed.

Every day, the highlighted province changes and gives the player a new opportunity to play another round.

## Todo

- The buttons at the top of the page need to be implemented
  - For example, we should put a dark mode feature
  - We could put a hard mode with no combobox or lower guess allowance
- A leaderboard or statistics metric should be kept
- Add basic unit tests
- Implement user profiles to maintain stats
